============

The following packages are required to be installed on your system in order
to build this program:

libqt4-dev

Building
========

In order to build this program, open a terminal and cd into the antimicro
directory. Enter the following commands in order to build the program:

There is no install option as of yet. As I learn more about how to
customize qmake, I will add an install directive so the program can
be installed system-wide.
