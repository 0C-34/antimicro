Version 1.2

* Improved while held set changing so that the program should not get stuck on
the wrong set. The changes made should behave roughly like the old while held
workaround that used turbo.

* Windows port of AntiMicro has been made.

* Tweaked code used for button presses and releases in order
to improve responsiveness.

* Allow time-dependent action slots to have an interval
as low as 0.01 seconds.

* Tweaked Release action slot. Release slots can now be placed at the
beginning of the assigned slots. This can be useful for
Tap and Hold slot configurations.

* Pause slots can now be used with Release slots.

* Profiles can be removed from the recent configs list.

* Spring mouse mode preview has now been enabled.

* Mouse speed modifier action slot has been added. This can be used to modify
the mouse speed settings used with any controller element while the slot is
active. The setting will modify the mouse speed by the percentage that is
specified. The mouse speed modifier can be used to allow for the mouse speed
to be slowed down while sniping.

* Button and action names have been added. Names can be used to describe
the action that a slot sequence performs in the game.

* Mouse wheel buttons are now used as a form of mouse movement. Mouse wheel
scrolling is now possible without using turbo. The speed that the wheel is
rotated can be specified in the mouse settings dialog window.

* Added support for two extra mouse buttons.

* A new controller properties window has been made. This window shows various
bits of information provided by SDL about a controller as well as the current
values of all the controller elements.

* Added quick assign functionality for sticks and virtual dpads.

* Windows version of the program now uses LocalAppData variable to know
where to place the program's settings file.

* New translations provided by the translation team.

Version 1.1

* Added spring mouse mode. This mode is used to move the mouse cursor
from the center of the screen based on how much an axis has been moved
from the dead zone. The mouse cursor will be returned to the center
of the screen when the axis is released.

* Added mouse curve options from QJoyPad.

* Tweaked mouse movement in cursor mode to improve axis responsiveness
and to allow mouse movement to be less jittery.

* Added optional mouse smoothing for a further reduction
in jitter in exchange for slightly delayed responsiveness.

* Moved various mouse settings into a new dialog window.
Several other dialog windows have been changed to point to the
new dialog window to allow for mouse setting adjustments.

* Added an option to start the program hidden.

* Tray menu has been tweaked to allow configuration profiles to be
disabled. A blank new profile will be enabled in the program
for a controller. This is equivalent to selecting <New> in the main window
combobox.

* Serbian translation provided by Jay Alexander Fleming.

* Brazilian Portuguese translation provided by VaGNaroK.

Version 1.0

* 8-way controls have been implemented. This allows keys to be mapped
to the diagonal directions of controller sticks and dpads. 8-way controls
allow rougelike games to be playable.

* Virtual Dpad support has been added. Axes and buttons can be mapped
to a virtual dpad. This is useful for mapping dpads that are detected as a
pair of axes in SDL.

* A Quick Set option has been added. Using the Quick Set option, you
can press a button on the controller and the program will bring up the edit
window for that specific button.  The button can then be mapped to an
assignment from the edit window. The Quick Set option also works for axes,
controller sticks, and dpads. This is more of a convenience function than
anything but I have found it really useful since implementing it.

* Main interface button text is now updated whenever the assigned slots
are changed. This allows the buttons' text to be in sync in many situations
that was not possible before.

* Toggle and Turbo can be used together to create automated key macros for
use in MMORPGs.
