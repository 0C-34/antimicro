Version 1.1

* Added spring mouse mode. This mode is used to move the mouse cursor
from the center of the screen based on how much an axis has been moved
from the dead zone. The mouse cursor will be returned to the center
of the screen when the axis is released.

* Added mouse curve options from QJoyPad.

* Tweaked mouse movement in cursor mode to improve axis responsiveness
and to allow mouse movement to be less jittery.

* Added optional mouse smoothing for a further reduction
in jitter in exchange for slightly delayed responsiveness.

* Moved various mouse settings into a new dialog window.
Several other dialog windows have been changed to point to the
new dialog window to allow for mouse setting adjustments.

* Added an option to start the program hidden.

* Tray menu has been tweaked to allow configuration profiles to be
disabled. A blank new profile will be enabled in the program
for a controller. This is equivalent to selecting <New> in the main window
combobox.

Version 1.0

* 8-way controls have been implemented. This allows keys to be mapped
to the diagonal directions of controller sticks and dpads. 8-way controls
allow rougelike games to be playable.

* Virtual Dpad support has been added. Axes and buttons can be mapped
to a virtual dpad. This is useful for mapping dpads that are detected as a
pair of axes in SDL.

* A Quick Set option has been added. Using the Quick Set option, you
can press a button on the controller and the program will bring up the edit
window for that specific button.  The button can then be mapped to an
assignment from the edit window. The Quick Set option also works for axes,
controller sticks, and dpads. This is more of a convenience function than
anything but I have found it really useful since implementing it.

* Main interface button text is now updated whenever the assigned slots
are changed. This allows the buttons' text to be in sync in many situations
that was not possible before.

* Toggle and Turbo can be used together to create automated key macros for
use in MMORPGs.
